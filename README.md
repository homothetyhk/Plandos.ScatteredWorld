# Scattered World
A plando which explores the possibilities of bench rando! This is meant to be a relatively accessible plando, featuring branching paths and complex routing. The goal is to defeat the Radiance.
## Dependencies
- ICDL, ItemChanger, Randomizer 4, RandomizerCore, MenuChanger
- Benchwarp, BenchRando
## Basic Information
- Pools
  - Dreamers, Skills, Charms, Keys, Mask Shards, Vessel Fragments, Pale Ore, Charm Notches, Geo Chests, Relics, Rancid Eggs, Stags, Maps, Grubs, Lifeblood Cocoons, Soul Totems, Boss Geo, Journal Entries, Junk Pit Chests, Mimics, Benches
  - Grubs and Mimics are placed in a separate group
  - Dreamers are at their vanilla locations
- Novelties
  - Swim, Elevator Pass, Split Claw, Split Cloak, Split Superdash, Egg Shop
- Required Skips
  - Almost none. There is one "Obscure Skip" (as defined by Randomizer 4) required by logic for the plando, but otherwise no skips required. There are many routes through the plando, and many places where skips are beneficial, however.
    - If you get stuck, this links to a message in the HK Speedrunning Server demonstrating the one required skip: https://discord.com/channels/772964112908156938/835442768008183838/903789959289376778
## Tips
- There is one custom location added by the plando. It will be relatively obvious from the start.
- A slight change was made to a certain area for the plando. It will be extremely obvious when it presents itself. Logic has been adjusted for the change, and no skips are required.
- Don't be afraid to upgrade your nail early and often!
